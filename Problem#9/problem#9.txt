Every student receives a grade  in the inclusive range 0 from  to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between  the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 , round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Eg. 84 = 85 ( 85-83 is less than 3)
29 = 29 (less than 40)
57 = 57 (60 - 57 > 3)
